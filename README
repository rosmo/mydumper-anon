== What is mydumper? Why? ==

* Parallelism (hence, speed) and performance (avoids expensive character set conversion routines, efficient code overall)
* Easier to manage output (separate files for tables, dump metadata, etc, easy to view/parse data)
* Consistency - maintains snapshot across all threads, provides accurate master and slave log positions, etc
* Manageability - supports PCRE for specifying database and tables inclusions and exclusions

It does not support schema dumping and leaves that to 'mysqldump --no-data'

== How to build it? ==

Run:
 cmake .
 make

One needs to install development versions of required libaries (MySQL, GLib, ZLib, PCRE):
NOTE: you must use the correspondent mysql devel package.

* Ubuntu or Debian: apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libmysqlclient15-dev zlib1g-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev
* Fedora, RedHat and CentOS: yum install glib2-devel mysql-devel zlib-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel
* openSUSE: zypper install glib2-devel libmysqlclient-devel pcre-devel zlib-devel
* MacOSX: port install glib2 mysql5 pcre pkgconfig cmake
 (You may want to run 'port select mysql mysql5' afterwards)

One has to make sure, that pkg-config, mysql_config, pcre-config are all in $PATH

Binlog dump is disabled by default to compile with it you need to add -DWITH_BINLOG=ON to cmake options

=== MacOSX homebrew formula ===

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for MacOSX.

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosmo/mydumper-anon/master/homebrew/mydumper-anon.rb
```


== How does consistent snapshot work? ==

This is all done following best MySQL practices and traditions:

* As a precaution, slow running queries on the server either abort the dump, or get killed
* Global write lock is acquired ("FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK")
* Various metadata is read ("SHOW SLAVE STATUS","SHOW MASTER STATUS")
* Other threads connect and establish snapshots ("START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT")
** On pre-4.1.8 it creates dummy InnoDB table, and reads from it.
* Once all worker threads announce the snapshot establishment, master executes "UNLOCK TABLES" and starts queueing jobs.

This for now does not provide consistent snapshots for non-transactional engines - support for that is expected in 0.2 :)

== How to exclude (or include) databases? ==

Once can use --regex functionality, for example not to dump mysql and test databases:

 mydumper --regex '^(?!(mysql|test))'

Of course, regex functionality can be used to describe pretty much any list of tables.

== How to exclude MERGE or Federated tables ==

Use same --regex exclusion syntax. Again, engine-specific behaviors are targetted for 0.2

== How to anonymize tables ==

You can specifying a YAML configuration file to the --anonymize flag. Anonymization
configuration supports truncation of tables, column editing (replace contents,
randomize with wordlists, randomized date/time/datetime).

Example of all operations currently implemented:

 anonymizer_settings:
   randomize:
     # wordlist_id: file_with_words_one_per_line.txt
     firstname: firstnames.txt
     lastname: lastnames.txt
     fullname: fullnames.txt
    
 database_name:
   table_name_1:
     truncate: yes
  
   table_name_2:
     edit:
       - when: {folder: '^config$', path: '^secret/key1'}
         set: {value: ''}
       - when: {folder: '^config$', path: '^secret/key2'}
         set: {value: ''}
   
   table_name_3:
     edit:
       - when: {}
         set: {customer_name: 'John {{user_id}}', customer_address: 'Fixed Street 1'}

   table_name_4:
     randomize:
       column_name:
         type: 'fullname'
       datetime_column_name:
         type: 'datetime'
       time_column_name:
         type: 'time'
       date_column_name:
         type: 'date'
	
   # Modifiers are separated with |, currently only md5 supported. Additionally you can 
   # specify a ":n" after the modifier to only take n amount of characters.
   table_name_5:
     edit:
       - when: {email: '.+'}
         set: {email: '{{id_user|md5:10}}@anonymized.com', name: '{{name|md5}}'}
